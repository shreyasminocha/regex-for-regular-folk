title: Groups
---

Groups, as the name suggests, are meant to be used to "group" components of regular expressions. These groups can be used to:

-   Extract subsets of matches
-   [Repeat groups an arbitrary number of times](/chapters/repetition)
-   Refer to previously matched substrings
-   Enhance readability
-   [Allow complex alternations](/chapters/alternations)

We'll see how to do a lot of this in later chapters, but learning how groups work will allow us to study some great examples in these later chapters.

## Capturing groups

Capturing groups are denoted by `(` … `)`. Here's an expository example:

<Example regex={/a(bcd)e/g}>
    <li>abcde</li>
    <li>abcdefg?</li>
    <li>abcde</li>
</Example>

Capturing groups allow _extracting_ parts of matches.

<Example regex={/\{([^{}]*)\}/g}>
    <li>{"{braces}"}</li>
    <li>{"{two} {pairs}"}</li>
    <li>{"{ {nested} }"}</li>
    <li>{"{ incomplete } }"}</li>
    <li>{"{}"}</li>
    <li>{"{unmatched"}</li>
</Example>

Using your language's regex functions, you would be able to extract the text between the matched braces for each of these strings.

Capturing groups can also be used to group regex parts for ease of [repetition](/repetition) of said group. While we will cover repetition in detail in chapters that follow, here's an example that demonstrates the utility of groups.

<Example regex={/a(bcd)+e/g}>
    <li>abcdefg</li>
    <li>abcdbcde</li>
    <li>abcdbcdbcdef</li>
    <li>ae</li>
</Example>

Other times, they are used to group logically similar parts of the regex for readability.

<Example regex={/(\d\d\d\d)-W(\d\d)/g}>
    <li>2020-W12</li>
    <li>1970-W01</li>
    <li>2050-W50-6</li>
    <li>12050-W50</li>
</Example>

### Backreferences

Backreferences allow referring to _previously captured substrings_.

The match from the first group would be `\1`, that from the second would be `\2`, and so on…

<Example regex={/([abc])×\1×\1/g}>
    <li>a×a×a</li>
    <li>ab×b×b</li>
    <li>a×b×c</li>
</Example>

Backreferences _cannot_ be used to reduce duplication in regexes. They refer to _the match_ of groups, not the pattern.

<Example regex={/[abc][abc][abc]/g}>
    <li>abc</li>
    <li>a cable</li>
    <li>aaa</li>
    <li>bbb</li>
    <li>ccc</li>
</Example>

<Example regex={/([abc])\1\1/g}>
    <li>abc</li>
    <li>a cable</li>
    <li>aaa</li>
    <li>bbb</li>
    <li>ccc</li>
</Example>

Here's an example that demonstrates a common use-case:

<Example regex={/\w+([,|])\w+\1\w+/g}>
    <li>comma,separated,values</li>
    <li>pipe|separated|values</li>
    <li>wb|mixed,delimiters</li>
    <li>wb,mixed|delimiters</li>
</Example>

This cannot be achieved with a repeated character classes.

<Example regex={/\w+[,|]\w+[,|]\w+/g}>
    <li>comma,separated,values</li>
    <li>pipe|separated|values</li>
    <li>wb|mixed,delimiters</li>
    <li>wb,mixed|delimiters</li>
</Example>

## Non-capturing groups

Non-capturing groups are very similar to capturing groups, except that they don't create "captures". They take the form `(?:` … `)`.

Non-capturing groups are usually used in conjunction with capturing groups. Perhaps you are attempting to extract some parts of the matches using capturing groups. You may wish to use a group _without messing up the order of the captures_. This is where non-capturing groups come handy.

## Examples

### Query String Parameters

<Example regex={/^\?(\w+)=(\w+)(?:&(\w+)=(\w+))*$/g}>
    <li></li>
    <li>?</li>
    <li>?a=b</li>
    <li>?a=b&foo=bar</li>
</Example>

We match the first key-value pair separately because that allows us to use `&`, the separator, as part of the repeating group.

### (Basic) HTML tags

As a rule of thumb, _do not_ use regex to match XML/HTML.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

However, it's a relevant example:

<Example regex={/<([a-z]+)+>(.*)<\/\1>/gi}>
    <li>{"<p>paragraph</p>"}</li>
    <li>{"<li>list item</li>"}</li>
    <li>{"<p><span>nesting</span></p>"}</li>
    <li>{"<p>hmm</li>"}</li>
    <li>{"<p><p>not clever</p></p></p>"}</li>
</Example>

### Names

**Find**: `\b(\w+) (\w+)\b`

**Replace**: `$2, $1`[^5]

#### Before

```
John Doe
Jane Doe
Sven Svensson
Janez Novak
Janez Kranjski
Tim Joe
```

#### After

```
Doe, John
Doe, Jane
Svensson, Sven
Novak, Janez
Kranjski, Janez
Joe, Tim
```

[^5]: In replacement contexts, `$1`, `$2`, … are usually used in place of `\1`, `\2`, … to refer to captured strings.

### Backreferences and plurals

**Find**: `\bword(s?)\b`

**Replace**: `phrase$1`[^5]

#### Before

```
This is a paragraph with some words.

Some instances of the word "word" are in their plural form: "words".

Yet, some are in their singular form: "word".
```

#### After

```
This is a paragraph with some phrases.

Some instances of the phrase "phrase" are in their plural form: "phrases".

Yet, some are in their singular form: "phrase".
```
