title: Flags
---

Flags (or "modifiers") allow us to put regexes into different "modes".

Flags are the part after the final `/` in `/pattern/`.

Different engines support different flags. We'll explore some of the most common flags here.

## Global (`g`)

All examples thus far have had the global flag. When the global flag isn't enabled, the regex doesn't match anything beyond the first match.

<Example regex={/[aeiou]/g}>
    <li>corona</li>
    <li>cancel</li>
    <li>rhythm</li>
</Example>

<Example regex={/[aeiou]/}>
    <li>corona</li>
    <li>cancel</li>
    <li>rhythm</li>
</Example>

## (Case) Insensitive (`i`)

As the name suggests, enabling this flag makes the regex case-insensitive in its matching.

<Example regex={/#[0-9A-F]{6}/i}>
    <li>#AE25AE</li>
    <li>#663399</li>
    <li>Even #a2ca2c?</li>
    <li>#FFF</li>
</Example>

<Example regex={/#[0-9A-F]{6}/}>
    <li>#AE25AE</li>
    <li>#663399</li>
    <li>Even #a2ca2c?</li>
    <li>#FFF</li>
</Example>

<Example regex={/#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}/}>
    <li>#AE25AE</li>
    <li>#663399</li>
    <li>Even #a2ca2c?</li>
    <li>#FFF</li>
</Example>

## Multiline (`m`)

<Support>
    In Ruby, the <code>m</code> flag performs{" "}
    <a href="#dot-all-s">other functions</a>.
</Support>

The multiline flag has to do with the regex's handling of anchors when dealing with "multiline" strings—strings that include newlines (`\n`). By default, the regex `/^foo$/` would match only `"foo"`.

We might want it to match `foo` when it is in a line by itself in a multiline string.

Let's take the string `"bar\nfoo\nbaz"` as an example:

```
bar
foo
baz
```

Without the multiline flag, the string above would be considered as a single line `bar\nfoo\nbaz` for matching purposes. The regex `^foo$` would thus **not match** anything.

With the multiline flag, the input would be considered as three "lines": `bar`, `foo`, and `baz`. The regex `^foo$` _would match_ the line in the middle—`foo`.

## Dot-all (`s`)

<Support>
    JavaScript, prior to ES2018, did not support this flag. Ruby does not
    support the flag, instead using <code>m</code> for the same.
</Support>

The `.` typically matches any character except newlines. With the dot-all flag, it matches newlines too.

## Unicode (`u`)

In the presence of the `u` flag, the regex and the input string will be interpreted in a unicode-aware way. The details of this are implementation-dependent, but here are some things to expect:

-   [Character classes](/chapters/character-classes) may match [astral symbols](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-unicode#unicode-basics).
-   [Character escapes](/chapters/character-escapes) may match astral symbols and may be unicode-aware.
-   The [`i` flag](#case-insensitive-i) may use [Unicode's case-folding](https://unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/CaseFolding.txt) logic.
-   The use of some features like unicode codepoint escapes and [unicode property escapes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Unicode_Property_Escapes) may be enabled.

## Whitespace extended (`x`)

When this flag is set, whitespace in the pattern is ignored (unless escaped or in a [character class](/chapters/character-classes)). Additionally, characters following `#` on any line are ignored. This allows for comments and is useful when writing complex patterns.

Here's an example from [_Advanced Examples_](/chapters/advanced-examples), formatted to take advantage of the whitespace extended flag:

```regex
^                   # start of line
    (
        [+-]?       # sign
        (?=\.\d|\d) # don't match `.`
        (?:\d+)?    # integer part
        (?:\.?\d*)  # fraction part
    )
    (?:             # optional exponent part
        [eE]
        (
            [+-]?   # optional sign
            \d+     # power
        )
    )?
$                   # end of line
```
