Regular expressions are typically formatted as `/<rules>/<flags>`. Often people will drop the slashes and flags for brevity. We'll get into the details of flags in [a later chapter](flags).

Let's start with the regex `/p/g`. For now, please take the [`g` flag](flags#global-g) for granted.

<Example regex={/p/g}>
    <li>pancake</li>
    <li>pineapple</li>
    <li>apple</li>
    <li>mango</li>
    <li>Plum</li>
</Example>

As we can see, `/p/g` matches all lowercase `p` characters.

<Note>Regular expressions are case-sensitive by default.</Note>

Instances of the regex pattern found in an input string are termed "matches".

<Example regex={/pp/g}>
    <li>apple</li>
    <li>pineapple</li>
    <li>happiness</li>
    <li>sipping apple juice</li>
    <li>papaya</li>
</Example>
